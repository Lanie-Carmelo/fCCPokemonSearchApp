# Pokémon Search App

## Project Overview
The Pokémon Search App is a web application developed as the final certification project for freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum. This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript, API integration, and dynamic web content manipulation.

## Key Features
- Search functionality for Pokémon by name or ID
- Display of Pokémon details including name, ID, image, weight, height, and type
- Presentation of Pokémon stats such as HP, attack, defense, and speed
- Error handling for invalid searches
- Responsive design for various device sizes

## Technical Highlights
- Integration with freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy for data retrieval
- Asynchronous JavaScript for API calls and data handling
- Dynamic DOM manipulation to update the UI with search results
- Error handling and user feedback for improved user experience

## Development Challenges
As a developer with visual impairments, creating this app presented unique challenges:
- Implementing a visually appealing layout for sighted users while ensuring screen reader accessibility
- Handling and presenting image data without visual feedback
- Ensuring clear and descriptive error messages for both visual and non-visual users
- Structuring the code for maintainability and readability without visual cues

## Learning Outcomes
This project provided valuable experience in:
- Working with external APIs and handling asynchronous data
- Implementing search functionality and dynamic content updates
- Balancing visual design with accessibility considerations
- Applying JavaScript skills to create an interactive web application

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the UI with more detailed Pokémon information
- Implement caching to improve performance for repeated searches
- Add compare functionality to view multiple Pokémon side by side
- Incorporate sound effects or descriptions for a more immersive experience
